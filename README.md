# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
A little bit about myself, I'm a recent undergrad from UT Austin currently working as a Data Engineer at PNC. I want to expand my knowledge across all data domains from analytics to infrastructure to science. I'm hoping to take my data talents into the MMA Analytics space. For fun, I like trying new food spots, working out, playing sports, and watching MMA.
